// Background ::

// What are Chromebooks?
> Chromebooks are portable, energy-efficient, and affordable computers developed between Google and several computer manufacturers (Acer, Asus, Toshiba, Lenovo, etc.).
> While the manufacturer delivers the hardware, Google equips these devices with Chrome OS.
> Chrome OS can be described as a simple and light OS specifically design for simple media and processing work.
> Google envisioned Chromebooks to be used by the mainstream consumer, which uses computers for web browsing, email, video streaming, and maybe some light word processign.

// Why NOT Chrome OS?
> Chrome OS is a very limited OS. It is also incompatible with any other mainstream OS, including open-source distributions of Linux.
> Given the low price tag on the system, many users have attempted to fit mainstream OSs within Chromebooks.
> Although a difficult task, it has been possible primarily for light Linux distributions.

// Why Gallium OS?
> Gallium OS, released for the first time on December 2015, is the first formal attempt at costum-designing a Linux distribution for Chromebooks.
> Gallium is a light version of Linux but without compromises! Hence, it is currently the best alternative available.
