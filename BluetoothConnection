// Background ::

> Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances (using short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the ISM band from 2.4 to 2.485 GHz[4]) from fixed and mobile devices, and building personal area networks (PANs).
> Bluetooth modules and/or antennas can be adapted to micro-controllers in order to communicate sensor data to a control system like the Raspberry Pi.

// Guide ::

1.0- Always update and upgrade raspbian!

> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt-get upgrade

2.0- Install bluetooth libraries and manager

> sudo apt-get install bluez pulseaudio-module-bluetooth python-gobject python-gobject-2

// Follow installation instructions if any

3.0- Change audio default settings

> sudo usermod -a -G lp pi

4.0- Change the default bluetooth settings

> sudo nano /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf

// Within the file, under [General] add...

Enable=Source,Sink,Media,Socket

5.0-Change the resampling algorithm from the pulse-audio configuration file

> sudo nano /etc/pulse/daemon.conf

// Within the text, find the line referring to resample-method and add...

resample-method = trivial

6.0- Reboot your raspberry

> sudo reboot

7.0- Ensure your bluetooth adapter is working

> sudo hciconfig -a

// All the information about the bluetooth module (USB-based most likely) will appear.
// The information includes module default name and bluetooth address

8.0- Perform a bluetooth device scan

> sudo hcitool scan

// The list of available devices will show within the terminal

%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Revision needed %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

9.0- Try openning a connection

> sudo hcitool cc XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

// Where XX:XX... refers to the bluetooth address of the device

10.0- Pairing with device

> sudo hciconfig hci0 piscan

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

11.0- Connect to device using the Bluetooth GUI

12.0- Verify device listed in terminal

> pactl list sources short

// Here, the device is listed as a source!!

13.0- 


3.0- Access bluetooth manager GUI from 

> Menu > Preferences > Bluetooth Manager
