# The HPH Knowledgebase

Hello and welcome to the Knowledgebase repo! An attempt to overcome my short memory syndrome while automatically documenting my work!

This repository has been divided in directories, each representing a topic. Each directory has been populated with short user guides and/or "how to ..." manuals. These documents are mostly ".txt" extensions for compatibility and disk-space conservation!
