// Description :: 
// This guide has been written with the purpose of guiding the user on the control of RebBoards (Arduino equivalents) by algorithms developed using Processing!

// Requirements ::

1.0- Install Arduino IDE

> https://www.arduino.cc/

2.0- Install Processing

> https://processing.org/

3.0- Connect RedBoard or Arduino board

// Guide ::

1.0- Install Standard Firmata
// In order for Processing's Java-based codes to control the Arduino, first the user needs to upload some software on the RedBoard (or Arduino). Think about this as the firmware update!

// To do this...

> Run Arduino IDE
> File >> Examples >> Firmata >> StandardFirmata
> Tools >> Select the appropriate "Board" and "Port"
> Upload Sketch

// For more details on how to use Arduino IDE, follow the corresponding guides for Arduinos

2.0- Open Processing

// In processing, the user may...

2.1- Develop their own application using Java

2.2- Open one of the Sample Codes within the Knowledgebase Repo. For isntance, "flashingLight.pde"
