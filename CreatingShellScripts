// How to Create a Shell Script

// This guide was written to guide the user into creating "shell scripts"

// Background ::

> What are "shell scripts"?
Shell scripts are short programs that are written in a shell programming language and interpreted by a shell process.
They are extremely useful for automating tasks on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.

> What is a "shell" or a "shell environment"?
The word "shell" refers to the command window or terminal. In other words, "shell scripts" are programs that run off the terminal.

// Requirements ::

1.0- Always perform system update and upgrade!

> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt-get upgrade

// Guide (Good morning, world!)::

1.0- Open a text editor. For instance, "leaf-pad" will be used throughout this tutorial

> sudo leafpad

2.0- On the first line of the document, type...

> #! /bin/bash

// The first line the operating system what shell to use to interpret the script and the location (i.e., absolute pathname) of the shell.
// The shell is bash, which is located in the /bin directory (as are all shells); thus the line contains /bin/bash.
// This instruction is always preceded by a pound sign and an exclamation mark in order to inform the operating system that it is providing the name and location of the shell (or other scripting language).

3.0- On the lines following the "absolute path", type the desired command

> clear
> echo "Good morning, world."

4.0- Save the file wherever with whatever name you like.

// In this example, the file was save with the name of "morning"
// The file was saved under the newly created directory "HPHApps", located in "/pi/HPHApps"

5.0- Attempt the first execution (no worries, you will fail!)

// Using the command window, execute the newly saved file
// An error will appear on the terminal, reading...

> bash: ./morning: Permission denied

// This error occurs because the file itself has not be set as an executable

6.0- Set file permission to executable

// Move to the directory of the file and, within the terminal, type...

> sudo chmod 755 morning

7.0- Execute NOW!
