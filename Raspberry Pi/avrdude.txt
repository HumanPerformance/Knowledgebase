#
# The following guide has been designed to guide the user on the implementation of avrdude, through the terminal/command window, to upload the USBtiny/Arduino bootloaders to the ATMega chips

# =====================================

# i   - Background
#
# New ATMega chips are not sold with loaded bootloaders for USBtiny or Arduino programming.
# In order to make these chips Arduino-ready, the corresponding bootloaders needs to be uploaded or "burned" to the chip.
# The burning process requires specific hardware and some terminals commands. This guides focuses on what we believe to be the simplest and safest method to accomplish the task.

# ii  - Requirements
#      a) Hardware
#         1.0 - SparkFun Pocket AVR Programmer
#      b) Software
#	  1.0 - Arduino IDE (will automatically install "avrdude")
#
# Note: This list of requirements assumes that your ATMega chip is already embedded on a PCB with pins available for programming.
# If the chip being used does not meet this criteria, follow the complete SparkFun guide in the references below.

# iii - Guide:
#
# 1.0 - Connect board to Pocket AVR Programmer
# 2.0 - Connect Pocket AVR Programmer to computer
# 3.0 - (Only on Windows) Find the location of the executable "avrdude" within your system
#	- "avrdude" should have been installed with the Arduino IDE 
#       - If you dont have the Arduino IDE, install the program prior to following this guide
# 4.0 - In the command-prompt/terminal change directory to that of "avrdude"   
> cd C:\xx\WinAVR-xxxxxx\bin (Windows)
# Note: For Windows, you may search for the executable "avrdude" using the start menu and then copy the path by opening the executable's containing folder.
> sudo avrdude (Linux)
# Note: In Linux, avrdude has already been defined on the system's path
# 5.0 - (Only for ATMega328P) Enter the following on the command-prompt/terminal
> avrdude -c usbtiny -p atmega328p -F
# Where:
# usbtiny - is the boorloader to be burned
# atmega328p - is the target chip/processor
# -F - overwrites signature modification on the chip/processor
