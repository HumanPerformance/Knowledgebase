// Fluvio L Lobo Fenoglietto
// Description ::
// Fetching and pulling committs consists of updating the local repo with the changes made to a given branch (or the origin)
// Guide ::
1.0- Move to local repo directory
> cd /local/repo/directoy
2.0- Verify the available branches
// This is  important as the user may prefer to fetch/pull from different branches
> sudo git branch -r
2.0- Fetch changes made to the repository
> sudo git fetch origin
3.0- Review committs added through the fetch command
> sudo git log --oneline master
// Recall that in order to exit the "log" command, the user must press the key "q"
4.0- Approve changes and merge them into the local repo
> sudo git merge origin/master
5.0- Alternatively, the user may skip the "fetch-merge" process by using "pull"
> sudo git pull origin
