1 - Raspbian Configuration

1.1 - Expanding file systems

	- From the terminal
	> sudo raspi-config

	- Exapnd file systems [Yes]
		Expanding file systems will allow Raspbian to use the full memory of the SD card.

x - CSEC Project Directories

	The following directories need to be created in order to maintain an efficient distribution of content (applications, repositories, and documentation) created for the csec project.

x.1 - Change to the home directory using cd

	- The user has several options;
		- Open a new terminal - automaticall located @ /pi/home
		- From any other directory
		> cd --

x.2 - Create "csec" directory using mkdir

	- From the terminal
	> sudo mkdir csec

x.3 - Create "/csec/repos/" using mkdir

	- From the terminal
	> cd csec
	> sudo mkdir repos

	- The repos directory will be used to store the repositories of all the content developed under the csec project.

	- Before we dive into the details of how to install every required program, here is a quick summary list:
	1.0 - Arduino IDE
	2.0 - Processing

x.1 - Installing Arduino

	- From the terminal
	> sudo apt-get install arduino

x.2 - Installing Processing

	- From the terminal
	> curl https://processing.org/download/install-arm.sh | sudo sh



---------------------
x - Git Configuration
---------------------

	Git will be used throughout this guide to clone/fetch/pull/commit/push the repositories of each application developed under the csec project.

x.1 - Setting global parameters

	- From the terminal
	> sudo git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
	> sudo git config --global user.name "yourusername"
	- It is not recommended to lock the password into the computer
