// This guide was written to guide the user in the process of mounting a network folder, created on a Windows environment, to Raspbian


// Requirements ::

1.0- Always perform system update and upgrade!

> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt-get upgrade

// Guide ::

1.0- Create folder within mount directory '/mnt'

// All mounted folders will be located within '/mnt/'
// This guide uses the HPH network folder, within IST, as an example

> cd /mnt/
> sudo mkdir HPH (or your folder name of choice)

// Recall that you may use the 'ls' command to verify the directory was created

2.0- Mount folder using its network path

> sudo mount -t cifs -o username=*****,password=***** //ist-02.net.ist.ucf.edu/HPH /mnt/HPH

// Note that the path used here is that of the ist HPH network folder
// This should mount the folder!!

3.0- If you wish to unmount the directory

> sudo umount //ist-02.net.ist.ucf.edu/HPH
