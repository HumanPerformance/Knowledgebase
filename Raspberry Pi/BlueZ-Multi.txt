// Background ::

> Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances (using short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the ISM band from 2.4 to 2.485 GHz[4]) from fixed and mobile devices, and building personal area networks (PANs).
> Bluetooth modules and/or antennas can be adapted to micro-controllers in order to communicate sensor data to a control system like the Raspberry Pi.
> BlueZ is the original and official bluetooth protocol stack for Linux

// Description ::

> This guide was meant for the communication of our prototypes with our control system, which is a Rapsberry Pi - Raspbian, its OS, is Linux distribution. 
> This guide has been built to demonstrate the capabilities for accessing multiple bluetooh-serial ports from your Raspberry Pi
> Given the specificity of the demo, some of the instructions may require referencing additional guides and tutorials from the HPH Knowledgebase

// Requirements ::

> Follow and complete the original BlueZ guide

// Equipment ::

> This demo was completed with the following tools/instruments/devices:
> Hardware:
>> 1.0 - Arduino Redboards (x2) - Arduino Uno shoudl work also
>> 2.0 - RN42 Bluetooth modules (x2)
>> 3.0 - Breadboard (x1)
>> 4.0 - Jumper wires
>> 5.0 - USB cable to connect Ardunions to computer
>> 6.0 - Barrel jack connectors to power Arduinos without PC
>> 7.0 - Bluetooth donggle for your Raspberry Pi or Linux system
> Software:
>> 1.0 - Arduino IDE
>> 2.0 - Copy of StandardFirmata.ino
>> 2.0 - BlueZ

// Guide ::

1.0 - Always update and upgrade raspbian!

> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt-get upgrade

2.0 - Install StandardFirmata.ino

> Prior to make any connection, upload the StandardFirmata.ino program to the Arduino boards using the Arduino IDE

> NOTE: A fresh copy of StandardFirmata can be obtained from the examples within the Arduino IDE (File>Examples>Firmata>StandardFirmata)

3.0 - Connect both bluetooth modules to their respective Arduino boards

NOTE: Use wiring diagrams for details. Here are some basics.

Bluetooth module pin / Arduino Pin
> TX / RX (Digital Pin 0)
> RX / TX (Digital Pin 1)
> GND / GND
> VCC / 5V or 3.3V --Depending on the module

4.0 - Power the two arduino boards with the barrel jack connectors

> If connected correctly, a flasing red light will be observed on the bluetooth modules.
> If you are using the same modules (RN42 - BlueSMiRF), the light will be flashing at about 1Hz (1 flash per second).

5.0 - On the Linux system (hopefully a Raspberry Pi! Hooray!), open the terminal.

6.0 - First, check the status of your bluetooth donggle
