// Background ::

> Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances (using short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the ISM band from 2.4 to 2.485 GHz[4]) from fixed and mobile devices, and building personal area networks (PANs).
> Bluetooth modules and/or antennas can be adapted to micro-controllers in order to communicate sensor data to a control system like the Raspberry Pi.
> BlueZ is the original and official bluetooth protocol stack for Linux

// Description ::

> This guide has been built to demonstrate the capabilities for accessing multiple bluetooh-serial ports from your Raspberry Pi

> Given the specificity of the demo, some of the instructions may require referencing additional guides and tutorials from the HPH Knowledgebase

// Requirements ::

> Follow and complete the original BlueZ guide

// Equipment ::

> This demo was completed with the following tools/instruments/devices:
> Hardware:
>> 1.0 - Arduino Redboards (x2) - Arduino Uno shoudl work also
>> 2.0 - RN42 Bluetooth modules (x2)
>> 3.0 - Breadboard (x1)
>> 4.0 - Jumper wires
>> 5.0 - USB cable to connect Ardunions to computer
>> 6.0 - Barrel jack connectors to power Arduinos without PC
> Software:
>> 1.0 Arduino IDE
>> 2.0 BlueZ

// Guide ::

1.0- Always update and upgrade raspbian!

> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt-get upgrade

2.0- Install Standar
