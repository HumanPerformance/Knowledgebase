// Background ::

> Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances (using short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the ISM band from 2.4 to 2.485 GHz[4]) from fixed and mobile devices, and building personal area networks (PANs).
> Bluetooth modules and/or antennas can be adapted to micro-controllers in order to communicate sensor data to a control system like the Raspberry Pi.
> BlueZ is the original and official bluetooth protocol stack for Linux

// Guide ::

1.0- Always update and upgrade raspbian!

> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt-get upgrade

2.0- Install bluetooth libraries and manager

> sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-dev libdbus-glib-1-dev libglib2.0-dev libical-dev libreadline-dev libudev-dev libusb-dev make

Follow installation instructions if any

3.0- Download source

The user must know the latest (or desired) version of BlueZ to install. For more information, visit http://www.bluez.org/

> mkdir -p work/bluepy
> cd work/bluepy
> wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/bluetooth/bluez-5.37.tar.xz
> tar xvf bluez-5.37.tar.xz

As of 02/04/2016, version 5.37 is the latest iteration of BlueZ

4.0- Once the download is completed, the user must build the program by...

> cd bluez-5.32
> ./configure --disable-systemd
> make

Note that the make process mayu take upwards of 30 minutes to 1 hour...

5.0- Once finished making, install...

> sudo make install

6.0- While you are at it, install the utilities also

> sudo apt-get install bluez-utils

7.0- Reboot your Raspberry Pi

> sudo reboot

7.0- Ensure your bluetooth adapter is working

> sudo hciconfig -a

// All the information about the bluetooth module (USB-based most likely) will appear.
// The information includes module default name and bluetooth address

8.0- Perform a bluetooth device scan

> sudo hcitool scan

// The list of available devices will show within the terminal

%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Revision needed %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

9.0- Try openning a connection

> sudo hcitool cc XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

// Where XX:XX... refers to the bluetooth address of the device

10.0- Pairing with device

> sudo hciconfig hci0 piscan

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

11.0- Connect to device using the Bluetooth GUI

12.0- Verify device listed in terminal

> pactl list sources short

// Here, the device is listed as a source!!

13.0- 


3.0- Access bluetooth manager GUI from 

> Menu > Preferences > Bluetooth Manager
