# Background ::
# Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances (using short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the ISM band from 2.4 to 2.485 GHz[4]) from fixed and mobile devices, and building personal area networks (PANs).
# Bluetooth modules and/or antennas can be adapted to micro-controllers in order to communicate sensor data to a control system like the Raspberry Pi.
# BlueZ is the original and official bluetooth protocol stack for Linux

# Guide ::

# 1.0- Always update and upgrade raspbian!

> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt-get upgrade

# 2.0- Install bluetooth libraries and manager

> sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez blueman

# Although the Raspberry Pi 3 comes with a built-in bluetooth antenna, it does not come with bluetooth libraries.
# Follow installation instructions if any...

# 3.0- Reboot System

> sudo reboot

# 4.0- Run the scan tool to find devices in range

> hcitool scan

# A list of devices in range will be printed on the terminal.
# Ensure that the target/desired device is listed! Otherwise, troubleshoot and repeat step 4.0...

# 5.0- Pairing/Connecting Device

> sudo bluetoothctl

# This command will print information about the raspberry pi antenna, followed by the line "[bluetooth]#".
# On this new line, type the following...

>[bluetooth]# agent on
>[bluetooth]# default-agent

# For devices that need PIN codes for pairing, the user also needs to use the scanning tool built into bluetoothctl...

>[bluetooth]# scan on

# Note that this list will continue to be populated until the scanning is set to off, which will be done after pairing is completed...
# In order to pair...

>[bluetooth]# pair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

# Where XXs are replaced with the device specific values...
# This will be followed by the messages...

> Attempting to pair with XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
> Request PIN code
> [agent] Enter PIN code: YYYY

# Where Ys represent the digits of the PIN code to be entered by the user...
# This will be followed by the message...

> Pairing successful

# Now the user can stop the scanning process...

>[bluetooth]# scan off

# 6.0- Setting device as trusted

> [bluetooth]# trust XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

# 7.0- Verify paired/trusted devices

> [bluetooth]# devices
